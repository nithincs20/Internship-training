// 1. Write some code which explain diff. b/w let and const
// 2. write a function which accepts two arguments, to add two numbers and return the result
//      2.1 convert the above method into an arrow function
// 3. Callback example: Pass a function as argument to above function, and that should get executed inside it.
//     printResult(param) { console.log('The result is' + param) }
// 4. Values of this in different situations
// 5. Closure : Write a function that accepts a number(multiplier) and this function should return another function,
//      that should have the capability to accept a number and return a result which should be multiplied with the earlier multiplier
//  multiplyByX(10) => multiplyBy10 => multiplyBy10(100)
// 6. Promise : 
//      const myHeavyTask = () => new Promise((resolve, reject) => setTimeout(()=> resolve('Hello world!'), 8000))
